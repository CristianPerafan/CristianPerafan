## Hi there 👋
My name is Cristian Perafan and I'm a software engineering student 💻 in the Icesi University in Colombia, I'm interesting on learning about new technologies as Blockchain and Artificial Intelligence 🤖.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on:
  - Neural network for a car 🚗 that drives itself with Java Script without a library:
    [Self dryving car](https://github.com/CristianPerafan/neural_networks_self_dryving_car.git).
